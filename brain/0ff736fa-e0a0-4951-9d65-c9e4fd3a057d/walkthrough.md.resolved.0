# Visualize Voxel Data Walkthrough

## Completed Work
I have successfully visualized the voxel map `.npy` file.

1.  **Loaded Data**: Loaded `Fishing_1006001_Global.npy` which contained dense voxel data of shape `(134, 8, 134)`.
2.  **Color Mapping**: Implemented a bitmask-to-color mapping based on [VoxelMapDataFormat.md](file:///d:/fishinggame/precompute/VoxelMapDataFormat.md).
    - Water: Blue
    - Water Grass: LimeGreen
    - Stone: Gray
    - Deep Pit: DarkBlue
    - etc.
3.  **Visualization**: Created a 3D Voxel Plot.
    - Swapped axes to align with Unity Global Coordinates:
        - Plot X = Unity X (Right)
        - Plot Y = Unity Z (Forward)
        - Plot Z = Unity Y (Up)
    - Rendered the map successfully.

## Visualization Result
The visualization shows the water body with various features like grass areas (green), deep pits (dark blue), and structure (gray/brown).

*(Note: The visualization was displayed in the Jupyter Notebook)*

## Next Steps
The notebook `d:\fishinggame\precompute\PrecomputeVisualization.ipynb` is ready for further use or modification.
