# Migrate away from GitHub LFS

The goal is to stop using GitHub LFS to avoid storage costs while preserving all file content in the repository. Since your total LFS data is ~2GB and no individual files exceed GitHub's 100MB limit, we can safely migrate everything to regular Git.

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This process involves **rewriting your Git history**. 
> 1. You will need to **force push** to GitHub, which will affect anyone else working on the repo.
> 2. To completely stop GitHub from charging you, you may need to **delete and recreate the repository on GitHub** or contact their support to purge the LFS storage, as old LFS objects might persist in their backend even after a force push.

> [!WARNING]
> Please **make a full backup of your local project folder** before we start.

## Proposed Changes

We will use the building-in `git lfs migrate` tool to convert all LFS tracked files back into normal Git objects.

### 1. Identify and Fetch All LFS Data
Ensure all LFS objects are present locally before migration.
- `git lfs fetch --all`

### 2. Export LFS Objects to Regular Git
Run the migration command for all branches.
- `git lfs migrate export --everything --include="*"`

### 3. Clean up .gitattributes
Remove the LFS-specific lines from [.gitattributes](file:///e:/DocsHDD/EvolutionAndBetrayal/.gitattributes) so new files aren't tracked by LFS.

### 4. Push to GitHub
Force push the rewritten history to GitHub.
- `git push --force --all`

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Check if [.gitattributes](file:///e:/DocsHDD/EvolutionAndBetrayal/.gitattributes) still contains LFS filters.
- Run `git lfs ls-files` to ensure it returns an empty list.

### Manual Verification
- Verify that Unreal Engine can still open the project and all assets (meshes, textures) are functional.
- Check GitHub repository size and LFS usage (this may take some time to update on GitHub's side).
